# Spindle brew #1 - "503"

Our first Spindle beer ever is called "503". 
The name was chosen by public voting in the [Spindle Beername Vote-O-Matic](https://wearespindle.com/articles/spindle-presents-the-first-groninger-open-source-beer/) on our weblog in July 2017.  
It's a referral to "**HTTP Error 503 - Service unavailable**": *We are unavailable, drinking beer!*

### Salts / acids

In order to get the right brewing water, baking soda and gypsum will be added to our water during the mash and during the boil.  
Because water composition can change depending on where you are, take a look [here](http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/understanding-the-mash-ph/using-salts-for-brewing-water-adjustment) to see what you should add to get the perfect brewing water. 

## Brewing

Add the grain bill to the water. For our first batch, 1000 liters of water will be used.  
The beer will be mashed for 75 minutes.  
First, bring the mixture to 52°C.  
After 15 minutes, raise the temperature to 62°C.  
After 10 minutes, raise the temperature to 68°C and keep that temperature for 35 minutes.  
After that, raise the temperature to 72°C for 10 minutes and 78°C for another 5 minutes.  
Sparge with 1300 liters of water (1.3 x the amount of water you use in the mashing process).

Boil for 80 minutes, adding hops at 60 and 20 minutes and the lemon peel at 5 minutes.  
Add the last hop addition and [whirlpool](https://www.experimentalbrew.com/experiments/hop-whirlpool-does-steeping-lower-temperature-improve-final-hop-character) the wort. 

Cool the beer down to 17°C and add [S04 yeast](http://www.northernbrewer.com/safale-s-04-whitbread) ("English ale yeast").  
The beer should be kept at 19°C for 5 days for primary fermentation.  
Add the hops for dry hopping at this point.  
Raise the beer temperature to 16°C for 24 hours to rest the beer.  
Secondary fermentation happens for 14 days with a temperature of 2°C.
