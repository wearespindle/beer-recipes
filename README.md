# Devhouse Spindle beer recipes

This repository contains Spindle beer recipes.

## How it all started

Someday on a sunny afternoon in June 2017, this appeared in our Slack:

*Ok, best idea ever. We are going to make our own beer!*

*Which we can supply as sponsoring for tech events, parties and... drink ourselves.*
*Bax Bier Groningen is going to brew it. It’s going to be 2000 liters (that’s 6000 bottles).*

*The brewing / tasting process it open source (others can join), but there needs to be 42% of something in there and 13,37 grams of something else (1,337 would be OK as well).*

## Our brews

1. "[503](503.md)" - first Spindle brew ever. Brewed at the [Bax Bier](http://baxbier.com/) brewery in Groningen.  
2. TBD
